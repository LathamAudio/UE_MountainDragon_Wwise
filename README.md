Have you watched & listened to 'How To Train Your Dragon' or 'Game of Thrones' and thought "I could do that!" Have you ever wanted to work on improving your creature design chops? Have you wanted to work on implementing your audio in the Unreal Engine with both Metasounds and Wwise to compare them? Are you me, because that is a very specific set of goals? Anyways, here is your chance!

This is the Mountain Dragon from the Quadraped Fantasy Creatures pack for the Unreal Engine, found on Fab.com. It comes as a set of creatures that have all the textures, animations, and skeletal mesh needed to get started but no audio! That's where we come in. I have set up the Mountain Dragon with basic movement, flying, and attack controls and setup the audio hooks to implement your own sound design. Follow the steps below to get started.

3. Open the Wwise Launcher

## Setup Moutain Dragon Pawn
1. Open your Unreal project
2. In the Contnet Browser, open "BP_ThirdPersonGameMode" and change the Default Pawn to be "MountainDragon_BP"

## Adding the Mountain Dragon to other maps
Now that we have a dragon that can walk, fly, attack, breathe fire, launch fireballs we don't just want to use the test third person map. The "Stylized Fantasy Provencal" level is an appropriate looking setting for testing out your dragon sound design.
1. From Fab.com download "**Stylized Fantasy Provencal**", and add it to your project
	- https://www.fab.com/listings/ced19ea1-31ed-437f-ae64-2b6b1561fede
2. Open the "Main" level located in "StylizedProvencal/Maps"
3. With the Default Pawn set in the Game Mode set you should be able to download envoronments from Fab.com and use the Mountain Dragon in all of them!

### Next up... working with Metasounds and Wwise to add your own sound design!
